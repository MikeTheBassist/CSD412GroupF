        <p>You've stumbled upon the Steam Guilt Machine, a super advanced web application that is going to change your life forever. <br />
        <p>
            If you're like every other person in 2019, you have an extensive backlog of games on Steam that you will likely never play because you're too busy playing your
            favorite 3 games for the 20th time.  Steam Guilt Machine aims to change that.
        </p>

        The Steam Guilt machine looks at your Steam account and creates a curated list
        of games that you already own that you should play instead of buying new games that you won't play.</p>


        <p>Our advanced algorithms represent the peak of machine learning and panda-related technologies.  We hope you enjoy it.</p>
